# CSGDW Data Chat - Project Documentation

**Team:** Peak Route  
**Project Type:** Hackathon  
**Status:** Planning & Development  

## 🎯 Project Overview

CSGDW Data Chat is an AI-powered, multi-layered data interaction system that enables natural language communication with data at multiple levels - from dashboard filtering to deep database analysis to intelligent report enhancement.

## 🌟 Vision Statement

Transform how business users interact with data by providing a conversational interface that seamlessly bridges the gap between natural language questions and complex data operations, eliminating the need for SQL knowledge while enabling sophisticated analytics.

## 📋 Functional Requirements

### Must-Have Features (MVP)
1. **Natural Language Dashboard Filtering**
   - Parse conversational queries into filter parameters
   - Update visualizations in real-time
   - Maintain filter state context

2. **Basic Analytics Chat**
   - Answer simple analytical questions
   - Provide data-driven responses
   - Handle common business metrics queries

3. **Oracle Database Integration**
   - Secure connection to Oracle DB
   - Schema introspection and understanding
   - Basic natural language to SQL conversion

## 🏃‍♂️ Implementation Phases (Hackathon Timeline)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Hours 1-3)
- [ ] Basic Streamlit app structure
- [ ] Sample data loading and visualization
- [ ] OpenAI API integration setup
- [ ] Simple chat interface

### Phase 2: Core MVP (Hours 4-6)
- [ ] Natural language query parser (basic patterns)
- [ ] Dashboard filtering (2-3 key filters)
- [ ] Simple analytics chat responses
- [ ] Mock Oracle connection (use sample data)

### Phase 3: Demo Polish (Hours 7-8)
- [ ] Error handling for demo scenarios
- [ ] UI/UX refinements for presentation
- [ ] Demo script and key scenarios
- [ ] Backup plans for technical issues

### Phase 4: Presentation Prep (Final Hour)
- [ ] Final testing of demo flow
- [ ] Presentation slides preparation
- [ ] Team rehearsal
- [ ] Q&A preparation

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Define Demo Use Case & Scenario**
   - Select specific business domain (sales, finance, operations, etc.)
   - Create detailed walkthrough scenario with sample questions
   - Define expected outputs and user journey for demo

2. **Design AI Query Routing Logic**
   - Create pseudocode for natural language intent classification
   - Define decision tree: dashboard filter vs analytics vs database query
   - Specify trigger patterns and routing rules

3. **Component Assignment & Team Distribution**
   - Break demo requirements into parallel development tasks
   - Assign functional components to team members based on expertise
   - Define integration points and handoff protocols
